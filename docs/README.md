## Welcome to HunterPie Documentation!

This documentation is made to answer the most asked questions, help you understand how each feature works and how to use them and auxiliate developers to create their own extensions for HunterPie.

### What is HunterPie?

HunterPie is a software that reads Monster Hunter: World process memory and displays everything in a nice and simple-to-read overlay. It also integrates Discord with the game, showing everything about your hunt to your friends.
