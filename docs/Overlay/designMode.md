# Design Mode

The design mode exists so you can move and scale widgets with your mouse, you can turn it on by pressing the hotkey you set in HunterPie's settings (default: <kbd>ScrollLock</kbd>), it will highlight all widgets, making them clickable.

## Moving Widgets

To move the widgets, hover your mouse over the widget you want to move, hold the left mouse button and then drag it to where you want to place the widget.

## Scaling Widgets

If you want to make the widgets bigger/smaller, hover your mouse over the widget you want to scale and then scroll up/down to scale it.

- **Scroll Up:** Makes the widget 5% bigger.
- **Scroll Down:** Makes the widget 5% smaller.

> **Attention:** If the mouse scroll isn't working, go to your Mouse settings on Windows and enable the `Scroll inactive windows when I hover them` setting.
