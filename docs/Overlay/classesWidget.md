HunterPie v1.0.3.91 introduced a new feature. The Classes widget!

# What is the class widget?
It's a widget that shows the information about your current equipped weapon.

## Class Widget Settings
Each class has it's own separate setting, so if you want to place this widget for Charge Blade in (x, y) and for Insect Glaive in (x2, y2) you can! Use the Design Mode to rescale and move this widget. You can also disable them separately in your `HunterPie > Settings > Classes`.
